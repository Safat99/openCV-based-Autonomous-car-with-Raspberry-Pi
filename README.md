# openCV-based-autonomous-car-with-raspberry-pi-
This is for a fun project that I am starting right now!! 
This is doing based on Murtaza's workshop and other sources!!
I will describe the whole project later!

Sadly, the Murtaza workshop's theme didn't work in my Pi 4 with 2gb ram. So, I needed to to do something different. Here Nabil vai test code became very much helpfu and suitable for my situation. All the descripitons and documentations are done in a video. Lately I will include that video's link
