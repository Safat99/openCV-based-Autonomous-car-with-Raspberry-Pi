Check this [YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/_uvGQ6cCDds?si=tQSFqTP4Xs9WREUO) for a real-time demonstration of the project.

Inspired by "Murtaza's Workshop" a popular YouTube channel for robotics and AI though our Pi 4 has a poor configuration. As a result, we have to follow a different lightweight approach to solving all the problems. The video is long but I hope you will like this.

I couldn't finish this project without the help of Md. Iftekher Hossain Vai and my friend Semonti did a tough job in making the video. So much grateful to them üòç üòç
